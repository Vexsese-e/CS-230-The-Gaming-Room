CS 230 – Software Design Document
The Gaming Room
Overview

This repository contains my completed Software Design Document for CS 230. The project was created for a client called The Gaming Room and demonstrates my ability to analyze requirements, design software architecture, and communicate technical decisions clearly to both clients and development team members.

Client Summary and Software Requirements

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, from a single-platform application to a distributed, web-based system that could support multiple platforms. The software needed to allow multiple teams and players, ensure that game and team names were unique, support scalability, and operate efficiently across different operating systems. The design also needed to emphasize security, performance, and maintainability.

What I Did Well

One area I performed particularly well was clearly documenting the system architecture and design constraints. I effectively compared operating platforms, outlined design patterns, and justified architectural decisions in a way that would be understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This helped ensure the client’s requirements were translated into a practical and scalable design.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Process

Working through the design document before coding was extremely helpful. It forced me to think critically about system structure, constraints, and future scalability before implementation. By addressing requirements, architecture, and risks early, the design process reduced uncertainty and provided a clear roadmap that would make actual development more efficient and less error-prone.

Revisions and Improvements

If I were to revise one part of the document, I would improve the security section by including more detailed threat modeling and mitigation strategies. While security considerations were addressed, expanding this section with specific examples and diagrams would strengthen the design and better prepare the system for real-world deployment.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on accessibility, scalability, and ease of use. Features such as unique game and team identifiers, multi-platform support, and efficient resource management were all implemented directly from the client’s requirements. Considering user needs is critical because successful software must not only function correctly but also provide a reliable and intuitive experience for its users.

Software Design Approach and Future Strategies

My approach to software design emphasized modularity, scalability, and maintainability. I used object-oriented principles, layered architecture, and platform comparisons to guide design decisions. In the future, I would continue using techniques such as requirements analysis, UML diagrams, and iterative design reviews to analyze and design similar software applications more effectively.
